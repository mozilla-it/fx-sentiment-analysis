I basically use my iPad as a laptop and thus use the Firefox app as a desktop browser. For the most part, it serves this purpose well. The browser is easy to use, it loads pages quickly, and it‰Ûªs (admittedly limited) settings options are simple and straight-forward. However there are a few settings that could be changed to improve the user experience:1. Allow users to make desktop mode the default setting.2. Allow users to set a default start-up page instead of opening all the tabs that were left open during the previous session.3. Allow users to change the order of sites on the bookmarks and top sites pages.4. Allow users to create folders or categories in the bookmarks menu",,,meh,

I've never liked Top Sites, preferring to store my own sites. Although you can pin sites here, you cannot rearrange the order which is annoying. Once you navigate away from Top Sites, Bookmarks etc. there's no simple way to access these unless you open a new tab. A button on the menu bar would solve this. I also like the Safari approach that uses a drop down menu when you click on the search/address bar. I do welcome the tracker blocker but wish we could have an ad blocker too as ads eat into mobile data and take up too much room on smaller screens. Also could do with a 'do not track' request and the option to block 3rd party cookies, which I do on Firefox desktop. I would also like an easier way to delete private data as having to go through several menus before I close the browser is very tedious and irritating - it's a shame mobile devices loose the handy keyboard shortcuts desktop browsers have. Perhaps Firefox iOS could delete private data when you close the browser like the desktop browser does.

The custom search engine script is amazing, and finally allows me to use a custom search query for a trustworthy engine (StartPage). This finally pulls me away from the control of Google. However, some tweaks would make it a better product on iPad and iPhone:1) Add Adblocking ability from Firefox Focus. I realize that it is no small feat as Apple does not allow Firefox iOS to use the apple scripts for Adblocking, but adopting the block lists to the fully fledged app would be a gift to all.Update: 9/22/2017. Thank you for adding tracking protection, and at different levels! This is a huge improvement for user privacy and I commend Mozilla for continuing to fight the good fight against tracking.2) Make bookmarks editable (renamable) and their order organizable. Currently you can only delete or open them in a new tab as options. It's not a mature feature set.3) Move the new tab button on the tab viewing page from the bottom left to the bottom right. This keeps you from having to travel the diagonal from the tab button (upper right) to the opposite (bottom left) corner, switching hands. Useful on iPad, VERY USEFUL for iPhone use, which is often one handed.Update 11/9/2017The good guys at Mozilla DID IT! The new ‰ÛÏphoton‰Û layout is easier than ever to use! Thanks for listening to users and making the UI more accessible!4) the pin to top sites feature only allows one link to the domain of choice. If I want to have a link to my Amazon Orders, that will take over the general Amazon.com link. Make this more like the safari Favorites tab! There's no need to reinvent the wheel. Customization, privacy, and autonomy should be the hallmark of Firefox. Not some gimmicky, clunky suggested websites. What if I visit an illicit website and don't want to worry about it poppin up in a new tab?? I get it, use private browsing mode, but the suggested websites panel should be an option you can disable.Lots of potential, but the app needs some streamlining and more options for the user. Apple locks us down, but Mozilla can potentially set us free.",,,happy,
